        "\n",
        "The Central Limit Theorem states that, with some conditions, when independent random variables are summed, the properly normalized sum tends towards a normal distribution. This has important implications for quantitative genetics. For complex traits, modeling the contributions of individual loci to the observed phenotype can be very complex and in most cases it is not possible; however, the sum of the effects of all loci contributing to a phenotype of interest will tend towards a normal distribution.\n",
